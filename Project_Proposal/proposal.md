## Project Idea
Our project aims to combine services for job seekers as well as employers to streamline the job search process. This will combine many aspects from existing professional social and networking services as LinkedIn, Blind, and Indeed. Instead of having an end user juggle all of these profiles and services, we aim to create a more cohesive experience.

Job seekers will be able to develop a profile to share their connections, but also share their skills and provide anonymous feedback.

Employers will be able to more quickly filter lists of applicants, to more quickly find talent that fits the roles that they need.

The target users will be working professionals on both sides of the negotiating table.
