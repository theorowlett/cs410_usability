### The Problem

As any current job seeker will tell you, the age where you go into the office, look the hiring manager in the eye and shake their hand to get a job offer is long dead. With the rise in remote positions, not only would an applicant be competing against all of the local talent, but talent from everywhere. According to an article from Zippia, an average job seeker will have to complete 21 to 80 applications to land a single job. And that's no guarantee it ends there. So in the current landscape a person applying will have to check multiple job boards, track all of their applications in a spreadhseet or something similar, and have no way of quickly seeing the status of their application.

Recruiters also face similair issues. Managing applicants through multiple systems, parsing out data from applications to find qualified candidates, filtering out applicants based upon their criteria all causes tons of overhead and time.

### The Solution

Our project aims to combine services for Software Engineers as well as employers to streamline the job search process. This will combine many aspects from existing professional social and networking services as LinkedIn, Blind, and Indeed. Instead of having an end user juggle all of these profiles and services, we aim to create a more cohesive experience.

Job seekers will be able to develop a profile to share their connections, but also share their skills and provide anonymous feedback. Once a profile is developed, they can quickly apply to multiple positions that matches their criteria including title, location, skills, and benefits. We even plan to add a 'expected salary' that won't be public facing, so applicants can filter out positions that don't meet their needs, if employers choose to disclose salaries for positions.

Once applied, applicants will be able to track all of their existing applications that are currently open. They'll be able to see the status which is open, being reviewed, interview status, offer extended, or rejected/declined. Currently to see that data applicants have to log in to individual potential employer websites. When there's hundreds of applications, this would become increasingly tedious.

Employers will be able to more quickly filter lists of applicants, to more quickly find talent that fits the roles that they need. With the features that are facing the applicants we anticipate a large pool of users, so it would be advantageous to use our service to attract the best talent. On top of that, we want to streamline the hiring process by offering an intuitive interface that recruiters can use to filter talent. They will be able to easily change what categories are most important. For example lets say that there is a job req that was looking for an applicant with 10 years experience with Azure DevOps experience, C#/Powershell/All the Microsoft product stack experience, and preferbly a Masters Degree. Since A masters degree is preferable, whereas the DevOps experience was most important, we can give different weights to different categories.

Our solution adds value to users on both sides of the negotiating table, and we're excited to bring it to fruition.
